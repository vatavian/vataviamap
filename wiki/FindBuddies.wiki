= Letting your buddies find you =

Two currently known choices:
  * Run Google Latitude to send your location (no need to run VataviaMap to upload this way)
  * Use the upload option in VataviaMap Mobile to send to a server that makes your points available in a supported format. TODO: Document how the development server accepts and publishes points.
