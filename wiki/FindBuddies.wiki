#summary How to find your buddies and let them find you

= Finding a Buddy =

Your buddy must be locatable by retrieving a URL that results in one of the recognized formats:
  * [http://www.instamapper.com/ InstaMapper] API, normal or JSON (normal is preferred because it is smaller.) If you are logged in to !InstaMapper, [http://www.instamapper.com/fe?page=api go here] to activate the API and get your API key. Sample URL:

http://www.instamapper.com/api?action=getPositions&key=584014439054448247

  * [http://www.navizon.com/ Navizon] public XML link: log in, visit "Display the location of users in my group in Browser" then "Publish location to public URL" then use the Hyperlink. Sample URL:

http://my.navizon.com/Webapps/UserAdmin/UserService.asmx/GetUserLocation?user=XXXX

  * [http://www.google.com/latitude/apps/badge Google Latitude] KML or JSON point (JSON preferred because it gives more information.) Sample URL (use your buddy's badge number):

http://www.google.com/latitude/apps/badge/api?user=BuddyBadgeNumber&type=json
